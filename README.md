# KROLAN MAJITO ALIANO

 Hello Fellas!  A website that uses Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to present information about food, such as recipes, cooking tips, nutrition information, and restaurant reviews. HTML provides the structure and content of the website, while CSS is used to create visually appealing styles and layouts.   I have made a food website using HTML and CSS that can include elements such as headers, images, text, links, and lists to showcase the various types of food available and offer users a way to search and filter through the information they are interested in. CSS styles are used to add visual effects such as backgrounds, color, and typography to create a unique and appealing look for the website. With HTML and CSS, a food website is designed and developed to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users.
